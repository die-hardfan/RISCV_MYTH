# RISCV_MYTH 
Duration: 19th March - 28th March (10 days) 
RISC-V based MYTH Workshop
About
The "Microprocessor for You in Thirty Hours" (MYTH) workshop is a 10-day program jointly offered by VLSI System Design (VSD) and Redwood EDA. It provides participants a structured introduction to the RISC-V architecture, emphasizing the transition from software concepts to hardware implementation through hands-on labs. The workshop covers topics ranging from C programming and assembly language to designing and verifying a basic RISC-V CPU core. ​

Program Highlights
Hands-On Learning: Almost every module is lab-based, helping us become familiar with TL Verilog by applying and debugging.
Beginner friendly: The program is structured in such a way that, by the end of the workshop, we get a complete overview of how a program written in HLL (eg. C language) is compiled, assembled, and run on actual RISC V core (picorv32). This is immensely helpful in getting a bird's view of the whole process so we related better to what we learn.
Basic to Advanced: From combinational and sequential logic to pipelining a CPU and handling hazards, this workshop covers a wide range of topics to learn
​
Day-Wise Details
Day 1: Introduction to RISC-V ISA and GNU compiler toolchain, including integer number representation and arithmetic operations.​

Day 2: Exploration of Application Binary Interface (ABI), function calls, memory allocation, and basic verification flows using iverilog.​

Day 3: Digital logic design with TL-Verilog and Makerchip, covering combinational and sequential logic, pipelining, and validity concepts.​

Day 4: Development of a basic RISC-V CPU microarchitecture, focusing on fetch, decode, execute logic, and control logic implementation.​

Day 5: Completion of a pipelined RISC-V CPU microarchitecture, including load and store instructions, memory integration, and hazard detection and handling.
